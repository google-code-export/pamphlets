# _Islamic Pamphlet Project_ #

By the grace of Allah, a group of dedicated brothers and sisters has been involved in a pamphlet project set up to spread information about Islam and clear misconceptions. These pamphlets are easy to understand, eye catching and have been read by Muslims and non-Muslims alike as well as drawing readers closer to Islam.

Volunteers are needed to distribute and re-stock pamphlet holders at participating locations (e.g. Shops, Mosques) in their local area. For those that are distributing the pamphlets in mailboxes, please do not distribute to mailboxes that have a "no junk mail" sign as this is against the law and we've had complaints.
